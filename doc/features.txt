Features
========

- Simple model-view-controller architecture.
  - Controller is like the top of a typical PHP file, but without any input.
  - View is like the bottom of a typical PHP file, containing mostly HTML code.
  - Model is based on classes that map directly to database tables.
- Well-defined file layout -- every file belongs in a logical place.
- Error handler will show a stack trace on-screen and/or email you.
- Simple way to redirect to another page.
- Simple way to render output.
- Separates the layout (outer frame) of a page from the content that varies for each page.
- Targets PHP 5.2+. May work on a version for PHP 4 as well.
- Testing framework included.
  - Probably using SimpleTest, included in a subdir. (TBD)


Model Features
==============

- Light-weight.
- Follows Active Record pattern.
  - Database fields are determined from the database tables.
- Currently works with MySQL.
  - Will re-write to work with PDO.
  - Will hopefully retain both versions.
- Schema defined in an SQL file, with automatic updating to the database schema. (TBD)
- Migrations (TBD)


Controller Features
===================

- Not much!
  - Works pretty much like normal PHP.
- Authentication/authorization. (TBD)
- Input filtering. (TBD)
- Form handling. (TBD)
- Session handling. (TBD - may just have them use the PHP stuff directly)


View Features
=============

- Access to any (global) variable defined in the controller that calls it.
- Helpers for form elements (such as SELECT drop-downs). (TBD)
