===================
IDEAL PHP FRAMEWORK
===================

bin             programs and scripts to run on the development or production system
 generate       generators (similar to Rails generators) go in this directory (be sure to handle SVN/GIT/etc. and deleting as well)

framework       all PHP files that come with the framework (except BaseModel.php, which is in models)
 test           tests for the framework itself
 simpletest     testing framework (3rd party) used for testing of the framework, and application-level testing

config          configuration files
 base.php       either where most of the stuff goes, or pulls in everything else
 database.php   database type, server, database name, username, password, etc.

doc             documentation for the application (and the framework)

public          files that can be accessed directly by clients (make this your DOCUMENT_ROOT, if possible)
 abc/xyz.php    application-specific page controller
 images         image files that are pulled directly into the browser
 scripts        JavaScript files (or other scripts that get pulled into the browser)
 stylesheets    CSS stylesheets (or other stylesheets that get pulled into the browser)
 robots.txt     file to specify how/whether spiders should index us
 favicon.ico    icon to use in bookmarks (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - browsers look here very frequently)
 xxx            you can add any files or subdirectories that you want in here 

includes        application-specific include files (similar to helpers in Rails?)

models          PHP file for each class (auto-loaded)
 BaseModel.php  BaseModel class -- all models should inherit from this
 MyClass.php    application-specific code for MyClass class

views           PHP files that get displayed to user
 abc/xyz.php    generally corresponds to abc/xyz.php controller
 emails         views that get sent as emails, instead of seen in browser
 partials       partial views - parts of a page, shared by several views

layouts         common PHP/HTML that encloses (surrounds) a view, so all views have the same general appearance
 default.php    default layout, that will be used if render() call doesn't specify a layout

database
 fixtures       contains a file for each table, to load the database with test data
 schema         ????
 migrations     ????

test            unit tests to test PHP code
 models         tests for the model classes
 controllers    tests for each controller
 views          tests for each view

tmp             temporary files can be put in here
log             log files can be put in here


NOTE: All the directories can have any number of arbitrarily nested directories.

TODO: .htaccess file in top-level, to prevent direct access, except to public (and rewrite everything to public).
TODO: How does schema dir work?
TODO: How does migrations dir work?
